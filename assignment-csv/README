# Assignment CSV Medical Records

Hello,

for this project I used Java 21, Spring boot, Gradle and H2 as my in memory DB.

note: since I was short on time I focused more on the Java part and let the DB to be automatically created by the app.

I added a sample Dockerfile that I used in other projects but I couldn't test it, so I hope you can run it on your machine.
To run the app you can use the command "./gradlew bootRun" and the application will serve in the port 8089.

Thanks
